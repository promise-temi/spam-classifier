       "       \"we are very excited about this new upcoming stock about to explode montana oil and gas , inc . ( mogi ) to explore further opportunities in alberta canada , is an energy deveioper in canada ' s most highiy coveted reservoirs . aggressive investors and traders may want to watch montana oi | and gas again this morning ! montana oil and gas inc . ( mogi - news ) announces that the syivan lake oil and gas project is sti | | awaiting a rig at this time . the surface lease has been constructed and we have been waiting for a rig to become avaiiabie for over two weeks , and anticipate this to happen next week at the latest . the company has a 25 % working interest in the syivan lake project . symbo | - mogi current price - . 26 reasons to consider mogi : 1 . price charts confirm oi | prices are experiencing the strongest bul | market in a generation . 2 . natura | gas prices have tripled in the | ast two years . 3 . with multiple projects in high - gear and the expanding production on reserves potentialiy worth muiti - millions , mogi is seliing for less than 1 / 4 the vaiue of its assets . 4 . montana oi | and gas specializes in using new technology to turn unproductive oi | and gas deposits into profitabie enterprises . aiready shares in the oi | and gas sectorare rising faster than the overa | | market . in fact , four of dow jones ' ten top performing industry sectors for the past year are energy related . but it ' s in the mid - sized explorers and deveiopers like montana oi | ( mogi ) that the biggest gains are being made . in the last 12 months , many of these stocks made tripie and even quadruple returns . breaking news ! ! april 29 , - montana oil and gas reports the following update on its sylvan lake project . after several delays due to unseasonable weather and road closures in the province of alberta , the contracted drilling rig was moved onto location and ensign drilling has spudded the[ENTITY] w 5 m well . the company anticipates the road bans to be lifted shortly in compliance with government regulations and to resume drilling of the well immediately there after . the company ' s west lock project is also scheduled to resume completion of tie in upon lifting of the road ban . with the continued interest in our sylvan lake project montana oil and gas has prepared a detailed project description . project history the sylvan lake oil and gas field was discovered in the late 1950 ' s and has produced over 40 million barrels ( mbbls ) of high quality crude oil and 50 billion cubic feet ( bcf ) of associated natural gas , predominantly from the mississippian pekisko and shunda formations . the field remains in production today and continues to be down spaced drilled and expanded with the use of modern three and four dimension geophysics . the original freehold lease on section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m was leased to a major oil company , as was most of the sylvan lake field itself . an exploratory well was drilled by this major company in[ENTITY] w 5 m in 1958 and was abandoned after finding the shunda and pekisko formations completely eroded by post depositional cutting . as a consequence , the major company did no further exploration on this section and eventually bowed to the complaints of the freehold mineral rights owner and relinquished the deeper mineral rights ( below the base of the jurassic formations ) on the west one half of section 3 back to the freehold mineral rights owner in the early 1960 ' s . this relinquishment was extraordinary at the time as mineral right severance had very seldom ever been done and more specifically , not often by the major companies . accordingly , these mineral rights sat available and dormant until the early 2000 ' s as almost all oil and gas companies thought they were held by the original lessee . through diligent land work ( including field visits ) our partners discovered this relinquishment and quickly leased the west half of section 3 . since that time our partners have managed to lease an additional 160 acres ( one quarter section ) of section 3 . energy 51 has the right to earn 50 % of this prospect ( possibly 75 % ) with the drilling of a test well in[ENTITY] w 5 m . land discussion our partners have secured a 100 % working interest in the west half and northeast quarter of section 3 - 38 - 3 w 5 m . the land comprises some 480 acres ( one section or one square mile equals 640 acres ) . primary drilling spacing in alberta is as follows ; one quarter section spacing ( 160 acres ) for oil and one section spacing ( 640 acres ) for natural gas . the province allows for decreased drilling and production spacing units ( called holdings ) should you be able to prove to the province ' s satisfaction that more efficient drainage of reserves would result from increased well density . almost the entire sylvan lake field , pekisko pool , has been down spaced dramatically and should we be successful in discovering pekisko oil we will down space as well . geological discussion pekisko formation - - the principle target of this prospect is oil and associated gas production from the deeper ( older ) pekisko formation . the sylvan lake pekisko oil field lies on the up dip erosional edge of the pekisko formation . this edge is extremely rugged as its shape was influenced by both terrestrial drainage and seashore conditions . overlying this ancient shoreline are cap rocks ( impermeable layers ) of the mississippian lower shunda formation and cretaceous / jurassic impermeable shales . these erosional edge trap features are common throughout alberta and account for billions of barrels of reserves . production facilities discussion this immediate area has been developed for both oil and natural gas over the past forty - five years . accordingly a multitude of gas gathering and processing facilities and oil transportation facilities have been constructed . a major gas processing facility is located within two miles of our project with gathering system lines with one half a mile from our proposed drilling location . the capacity of the processing facility is approximately 70 mmcf / d with current throughput of only 46 mmcf / d . accordingly , excess capacity of 24 mmcf / d exists in the facility which would be in the best interest of the operator to fill as soon as possible . this gas processing facility also has oil pipeline access for the transportation of raw oil product to the main delivery terminals north of red deer , alberta . accordingly , trucking costs would be minimal to get oil product to the transportation system . for more detailed project description please see news release dated ( fri , apr 29 ) . good luck and successfu | trading . conclusion : the examples above show the awesome , earning potential of little known companies that explode onto investor ' s radar screens ; many of you are already familiar with this . is mogi poised and positioned to do that for you ? then you may feel the time has come to act . . . and please watch this one trade tuesday ! go mogi . penny stocks are considered highly speculative and may be unsuitable for all but very aggressive investors . this profile is not in any way affiliated with the featured company . we were compensated 3000 dollars to distribute this report . this report is for entertainment and advertising purposes only and should not be used as investment advice . \",\n",
